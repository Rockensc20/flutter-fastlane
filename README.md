# flutter_fastlane

An experimental repository for attempting to implement Fastlane tools with a Flutter project.
Based on the Flutter Starter Project, but extended with an implementation of Fastlane for Firebase Application Distribution.
Built to work with GitHub Actions and integrates Slack for notifications.

## Notes
Fastlane was setup in a way to only work for Android due to a lack of XCode, which is why the folder and its appfile as well as fastfile are in the android folder.
